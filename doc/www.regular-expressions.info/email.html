This regular expression, I claim, matches any email address. Most of the feedback I get refutes that claim by showing one email address that this regex doesn't match. Usually, the "bug" report also includes a suggestion to make the regex "perfect".</P> <P>As I explain below, my claim only holds true when one accepts my definition of what a valid email address really is, and what it's not. If you want to use a different definition, you'll have to adapt the regex. Matching a valid email address is a perfect example showing that (1) before writing a regex, you have to know exactly what you're trying to match, and what not; and (2) there's often a trade-off between what's exact, and what's practical.</P> <P>The virtue of my regular expression above is that it matches 99% of the email addresses in use today. All the email address it matches can be handled by 99% of all email software out there. If you're looking for a quick solution, you only need to read the next paragraph. If you want to know all the trade-offs and get plenty of alternatives to choose from, read on.</P> <P>If you want to use the regular expression above, there's two things you need to understand. First, long regexes make it difficult to nicely format paragraphs. So I didn't include <TT class=regex>a-z</TT> in any of the three character classes. This regex is intended to be used with your regex engine's "case insensitive" option turned on. (You'd be surprised how many "bug" reports I get about that.) Second, the above regex is delimited with <A HREF="wordboundaries.html" TARGET="_top">word boundaries</A>, which makes it suitable for extracting email addresses from files or larger blocks of text. If you want to check whether the user typed in a valid email address, replace the word boundaries with <A HREF="anchors.html" TARGET="_top">start-of-string and end-of-string anchors</A>, like this: <TT CLASS=regex>^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}$</TT> <A HREF="regexbuddy/emailanchor.html"><IMG SRC="img/rxb.gif" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=middle ALT="Analyze this regular expression with RegexBuddy" BORDER=0></A>.</P> <p>The previous paragraph also applies to all following examples. You may need to change word boundaries into start/end-of-string anchors, or vice versa. And you will need to turn on the case insensitive matching option.</p> <script type="text/javascript"><!--

</script><H2>Trade-Offs in Validating Email Addresses</H2> <P>Yes, there are a whole bunch of email addresses that my pet regex doesn't match. The most frequently quoted example are addresses on the <tt>.museum</tt> top level domain, which is longer than the 4 letters my regex allows for the top level domain. I accept this trade-off because the number of people using <tt>.museum</tt> email addresses is extremely low. I've never had a complaint that the order forms or newsletter subscription forms on the JGsoft websites refused a <tt>.museum</tt> address (which they would, since they use the above regex to validate the email address).</P> <P>To include <tt>.museum</tt>, you could use <TT CLASS=regex>^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,6}$</TT>. However, then there's another trade-off. This regex will match <tt class=match>john@mail.office</tt>. It's far more likely that John forgot to type in the <tt>.com</tt> top level domain rather than having just created a new <tt>.office</tt> top level domain without ICANN's permission.</P> <P>This shows another trade-off: do you want the regex to check if the top level domain exists? My regex doesn't. Any combination of two to four letters will do, which covers all existing and planned top level domains except .museum. But it will match addresses with invalid top-level domains like <tt class=match>asdf@asdf.asdf</tt>. By not being overly strict about the top-level domain, I don't have to update the regex each time a new top-level domain is created, whether it's a country code or generic domain.</P> <P><tt class=regex>^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.(?:[A-Z]{2}|com|org|net|edu|gov|mil|biz|info|mobi|name|aero|asia|jobs|museum)$</tt> <A HREF="regexbuddy/emailtld.html"><IMG SRC="img/rxb.gif" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=middle ALT="Analyze this regular expression with RegexBuddy" BORDER=0></A> could be used to allow any two-letter country code top level domain, and only specific generic top level domains. By the time you read this, the list might already be out of date. If you use this regular expression, I recommend you store it in a global constant in your application, so you only have to update it in one place. You could list all country codes in the same manner, even though there are almost 200 of them.</P> <P>Email addresses can be on servers on a subdomain, e.g. <TT CLASS=match>john@server.department.company.com</TT>. All of the above regexes will match this email address, because I included a dot in the character class after the @ symbol. However, the above regexes will also match <TT CLASS=match>john@aol...com</TT> which is not valid due to the consecutive dots. You can exclude such matches by replacing <tt class=regex>[A-Z0-9.-]+\.</tt> with <tt class=regex>(?:[A-Z0-9-]+\.)+</tt> in any of the above regexes. I removed the dot from the character class and instead repeated the character class and the following literal dot. E.g. <TT CLASS=regex>\b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@(?:[A-Z0-9-]+\.)+[A-Z]{2,4}\b</TT> <A HREF="regexbuddy/emaildots.html"><IMG SRC="img/rxb.gif" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=middle ALT="Analyze this regular expression with RegexBuddy" BORDER=0></A> will match <TT CLASS=match>john@server.department.company.com</TT> but not <TT CLASS=string>john@aol...com</TT>.</P> <P>Another trade-off is that my regex only allows English letters, digits and a few special symbols. The main reason is that I don't trust all my email software to be able to handle much else. Even though <tt>John.O'Hara@theoharas.com</tt> is a syntactically valid email address, there's a risk that some software will misinterpret the apostrophe as a delimiting quote. E.g. blindly inserting this email address into a SQL will cause it to fail if strings are delimited with single quotes. And of course, it's been many years already that domain names can include non-English characters. Most software and even domain name registrars, however, still stick to the 37 characters they're used to.</P> <P>The conclusion is that to decide which regular expression to use, whether you're trying to match an email address or something else that's vaguely defined, you need to start with considering all the trade-offs. How bad is it to match something that's not valid? How bad is it not to match something that is valid? How complex can your regular expression be? How expensive would it be if you had to change the regular expression later? Different answers to these questions will require a different regular expression as the solution. My email regex does what I want, but it may not do what you want.</P> <H2>Regexes Don’t Send Email</H2> <P>Don't go overboard in trying to eliminate invalid email addresses with your regular expression. If you have to accept <tt>.museum</tt> domains, allowing any 6-letter top level domain is often better than spelling out a list of all current domains. The reason is that you don't really know whether an address is valid until you try to send an email to it. And even that might not be enough. Even if the email arrives in a mailbox, that doesn't mean somebody still reads that mailbox.</P> <P>The same principle applies in many situations. When trying to <A HREF="dates.html" TARGET="_top">match a valid date</A>, it's often easier to use a bit of arithmetic to check for leap years, rather than trying to do it in a regex. Use a regular expression to find potential matches or check if the input uses the proper syntax, and do the actual validation on the potential matches returned by the regular expression. Regular expressions are a powerful tool, but they're far from a panacea.</P> <H2>The Official Standard: RFC 2822</H2> <P>Maybe you're wondering why there's no "official" fool-proof regex to match email addresses. Well, there is an official definition, but it's hardly fool-proof.</P> <P>The official standard is known as <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#section-3.4.1">RFC 2822</a>. It describes the syntax that valid email addresses must adhere to. You can (but you shouldn't--read on) implement it with this regular expression:</P> <p><tt class=regex>(?:[a-z0-9!#$%&amp;'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-9!#$%&amp;'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*|"(?:[\x01-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x1f\x21\x23-\x5b\x5d-\x7f]|\\[\x01-\x09\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x7f])*")@(?:(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?|\[(?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.){3}(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?|[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]:(?:[\x01-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x1f\x21-\x5a\x53-\x7f]|\\[\x01-\x09\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x7f])+)\])</tt></p> <p>This regex has two parts: the part before the @, and the part after the @. There are two alternatives for the part before the @: it can either consist of a series of letters, digits and certain symbols, including one or more dots. However, dots may not appear consecutively or at the start or end of the email address. The other alternative requires the part before the @ to be enclosed in double quotes, allowing any string of ASCII characters between the quotes. Whitespace characters, double quotes and backslashes must be escaped with backslashes.</p> <p>The part after the @ also has two alternatives. It can either be a fully qualified domain name (e.g. regular-expressions.info), or it can be a literal Internet address between square brackets. The literal Internet address can either be an IP address, or a domain-specific routing address.</p> <p>The reason you shouldn't use this regex is that it only checks the basic syntax of email addresses. <tt>john@aol.com.nospam</tt> would be considered a valid email address according to RFC 2822. Obviously, this email address won't work, since there's no "nospam" top-level domain. It also doesn't guarantee your email software will be able to handle it. Not all applications support the syntax using double quotes or square brackets. In fact, RFC 2822 itself marks the notation using square brackets as obsolete.</P> <p>We get a more practical implementation of RFC 2822 if we omit the syntax using double quotes and square brackets. It will still match 99.99% of all email addresses in actual use today.</p> <p><tt class=regex>[a-z0-9!#$%&amp;'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-9!#$%&amp;'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*@(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?</tt></p> <p>A further change you could make is to allow any two-letter country code top level domain, and only specific generic top level domains. This regex filters dummy email addresses like asdf@adsf.adsf. You will need to update it as new top-level domains are added.</p> <p><tt class=regex>[a-z0-9!#$%&amp;'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-9!#$%&amp;'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*@(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+(?:[A-Z]{2}|com|org|net|edu|gov|mil|biz|info|mobi|name|aero|asia|jobs|museum)\b</tt></p> <p>So even when following official standards, there are still trade-offs to be made. Don't blindly copy regular expressions from online libraries or discussion forums. Always test them on your own data and with your own applications.</p><h2>Make a Donation</h2>
